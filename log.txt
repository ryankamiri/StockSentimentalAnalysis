6/29 - model keeps overfitting, determined cause: lack of data
6/30 - data augmentation by back translation improved val accuracy to 95%
7/1 - model might be memorizing due to similiarity from translations, tested by giving 50% whether data is augmented, results: 85% val accuracy, plan: augment ONLY training and obtain more data
