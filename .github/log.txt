6/29 - model keeps overfitting, determined cause: lack of data
6/30 - data augmentation by back translation improved val accuracy to 95%
7/1 - model might be memorizing due to similiarity from translations, tested by giving 50% whether data is augmented, results: 85% val accuracy, plan: augment ONLY training and obtain more data
7/9 - model is overfitting, looking at research papers for nlp for ideal models and trying to obtain more data, getting about 76-80% val acc, going to focus on reducing loss
7/10 - improved pre processing, stemming works best, took out stop words and non letter characters such as numbers, identified problems: training data is resulting in low performance, bullish headlines are rated bearish, need manual fix, need new way to evaluate accuracy in model
7/11 - Devised new harverstor with newsfilter. Planning on using Gap Ups and Top Gainers for Bullish Stocks and Top Losers for Bearish Stocks
